## It is what it is !

This is a small utility program we use internally and it does what we need it to, 
we have been using it for over a year and it has functioned flawlessly during that time.

It was originally written out of frustration and it took just a couple of hours, so it probably 
needs a little work to tidy up some of the code.

It should work with Sourcegear Vault version 6.x.x and above, and Axosoft version 12 and above.

You can re-use much of the code with other source control systems, simply replace the code that gets the 
list or recent checkins that controls the main loop.
 
```c#
VaultTxHistoryItem[] historyItems
```

The code is provided as-is !!
